# Knowledge Discovery for GA2 based on GA1

## Introduction

This repository is using the [Linked Open Data representation of the Global Asssessment 1](https://github.com/IPBES-Data/IPBES_LOD/blob/main/Global%20Assessment%201/README.md) to identify new knowledge / literature produced after GA1 (2018).

## Methods

We use snowballing to identify the literature. The key-papers are the pu=blications which were used for the Backbround Mesages (BMs) as identified by the LOD representation of GA1.
